    <h1>Calculating the Original Lattice</h1>
    <p>
      We begin this exercise by first analyzing the selected
      repeating pattern. We shall try to find the lattice characterizing this pattern
      and use this information to calculate the corresponding
      <i>reciprocal lattice</i>.  Follow the instructions given 
      on the right side of the screen.
