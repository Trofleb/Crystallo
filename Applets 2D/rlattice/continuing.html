    <h1>Continuing with the calculations</h1>
<p>
Continue the process of selecting new series of parallel lines, 
measuring  the distance between them, and calculating a new series 
points along the normal to the series of lines at distances <i>K/d</i>.
<p>
After completing a few lines of points, click on the check button labelled 
&laquo;Show Original Lattice&raquo; and try to find the property of the series of points 
which have been created. By generating  more and more points, 
a pattern should appear which is indeed the reciprocal lattice corresponding 
to your original pattern.
