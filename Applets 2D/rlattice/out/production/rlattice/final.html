    <h3>The Complete Reciprocal Lattice</h3>

<p>
If both are activated, we can see below a superposition of the original lattice and the corresponding reciprocal lattice.
The basis vectors of the original lattice
are <b><i>a</i></b> and <b><i>b</i></b> respectively whereas the basis vectors
of the reciprocal lattice  are <b><i>a*</i></b> and <b><i>b*</i></b>. Each reciprocal lattice vector <b><i>h</i></b>
can be expressed by a linear combination of the basis vectors 
<i><b>h</b> = h<b>a*</b>  + k<b>b*</b></i> where <i>h</i> and <i>k</i> are integer.

The direct and reciprocal lattice's vectors
are mathematically related  by the following scalar products of vectors :
<center><table width=80%><tr>
<td align=center><b><i>a a* =</i></b> 1</td>
<td align=center><b><i>a b* =</i></b> 0</td>
<td align=center><b><i>b a* =</i></b> 0</td>
<td align=center><b><i>b b* =</i></b> 1</td>
</tr></table></center>
</p>

In this application, we have limited
ourselves in the two-dimensional plane. However, in order to study the atomic 
structures of real crystals by diffraction, it is necessary to  extend both
lattices (direct and reciprocal) in 3D. Consequently, to the three basis
vectors defining the unit cell of the crystal structure 
<b><i>a</i></b>, <b><i>b</i></b> and <b><i>c</i></b> 
correspond the three reciprocal lattice vectors 
<b><i>a*</i></b>, <b><i>b*</i></b> and <b><i>c*.</i></b>
The angles  between the direct lattice vectors are 
&alpha;, &beta; and &gamma; 
whereas the corresponding angles between the reciprocal lattice vectors are 
&alpha;*, &beta;* and &gamma;*.
In three dimensions, the reciprocal lattice vectors are expressed
by the following scalar products :
<center><table width=80%><tr>
<td align=center><i><b>a a* = b b* = c c* = </b>1</i></td>
<td align=center><i><b>a b* = a c* = b a* = b c* = c a* = c b* = </b>0</i></td>
</tr></table></center>
