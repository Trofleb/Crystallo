    <h1>Calculating the Reciprocal Lattice</h1>
<p>
Let us begin the process of calculating the reciprocal lattice. For this purpose, we shall pick one of the lattice points, which will be the origin of our calculations.
<p>
We then repeatedly select a second point and draw a line which includes our origin and our second selection. The process is completed by drawing additional parallel lines until all the lattice points are included.
We observe that all the lines are equidistant. Let us next measure the distance between two consecutive lines.
This distance <i>D</i> will be used in order to complete our task.
