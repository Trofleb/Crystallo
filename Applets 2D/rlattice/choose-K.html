      <h1>Choosing a value of <i>K</i></h1>
      <p>
	The points of the new reciprocal lattice fall along a
	perpendicular vector to these lines through our base point.  The
	distance to a new lattice point along this line is K/D, where D
	is the measured distance between the lines we just created.  K,
	is an arbitrary constant.  You'll be given a scroll bar to help
	set the value of K the first time points on our new lattice are
	created.
      <p>
	(You may opt to simply keep default value presented to you, of course.)
