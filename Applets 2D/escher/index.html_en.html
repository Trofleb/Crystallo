<APPLET CODE=escher.class WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=400>

You must have a java-enabled web browser. It appears that you do not.
(Sometimes a browser may not
work because although it is java-enabled, the java has been turned off).

<h2>Instructions to get started quickly</h2>

<P>
<CITE>Escher Web Sketch</CITE> allows you to draw repeating patterns.
You can select the symmetry of the patterns by clicking on one of the
icons in the bar above the drawing area. The drawing tools are selected
from the icon bar under the drawing area.  The scroll bar(s) on the left
will change the pattern size. The right hand side of the drawing area is
reserved for each drawing tool's usage. Typically it changes the pen
size and color.

<h2>Information on M.C. Escher</h2>

<P>
Numerous web sites exist dealing with the work and biography of M.C:
Escher. Only a very short selection is given here:

<H2>Crystallographically interesting aspects illustrated by <CITE>Escher
Web Sketch</CITE></h2>

<P>
Crystallographers will recognize the list of 17 2D space groups (plane
groups) characterized by their international symbol as described in <A
HREF="http://www.iucr.ac.uk/welcome.html#it"><CITE>International Tables
of Crystallography (Vol. A)</CITE></A>:

<dl compact="compact">
<dt> <VAR>m</VAR>
<dd> mirror plane (or rather mirror line in 2D)
<dt> <VAR>g</VAR>
<dd> glide plane (glide line)
<dt> integer
<dd> <VAR>n</VAR> indicating a rotational symmetry axis of
360/<VAR>n</VAR>&deg;
<dt> <I>p</I>
<dd> primitive unit cell
<dt> <I>c</I>
<dd> centered unit cell
</dl>

<h3>General and special positions</h3>
<P>
After selecting one of the 17 plane groups, the user may choose an
object (a colored circle for example) and move it around within the unit
cell. In some specific positions, the object and some of its
symmetry-generated equivalents may converge into a single point. This
single point is called a <i>special position</i>. All the others are
<i>general positions</i>.

<p>
It is also easy to see that the number of symmetry-equivalent points in
each unit cell depends on the point's position. The number is largest
for general positions and smaller on special positions. The number of
symmetry-equivalent positions on special positions is always an integral
fraction of the largest possible number.

<p>
This concept of general and special positions is important and is
directly linked to the stoichiometry as expressed by the chemical
formula of a crystalline sample.

<h3>Site symmetry</h3>

<P>
Special positions have not only the property of reducing the number of
equivalent points in a unit cell but also of increasing the symmetry of
the object sitting on a special position. The interested reader may
discover for himself the symmetry of the special positions.

<h3>Simple two dimensional structures</h3>

<ul>

<li> A <b>graphite</b> sheet: Select plane group
<VAR>p</VAR>6<VAR>mm</VAR>. Select a carbon atom (colored
circle) and move it until you obtain the typical honeycomb arrangement:

<li>A chevron like <b>parquet-floor</b>: Select space group
<VAR>p</VAR>2<VAR>gg</VAR>. Select the line tool. With one single line
placed suitably you can generate the full pattern. Observe the effect of
the unit cell size on the pattern!

<h2>History of <CITE>Escher Web Sketch</CITE></h2>

<P>
Since 1987, many crystallographers and many other specialists enjoyed
the attractive software written for the Macintosh by Terry Flaherty from
Loyola University in New Orleans. <i>Escher Sketch</i> was originally
created for the purpose of designing periodic decorations. It was soon
realized  however that this application was an excellent teaching tool
for the illustration of basic crystallography courses. It was easy to
select one of the 17 symmetry possibilities in two-dimensional space
(the 17 two-dimensional space groups or plane groups) and use the
symmetry operations to generate automatically 2D periodic pattern. With
the various tools available, it was thus easy to generate all
conceivable wall-paper (periodic) patterns.

<P>
In order to make such a program readily accessible to students and
teachers of crystallography, and others interested in the art of
periodic decorations, the current program has been developed in Java in
order to be directly accessible on the World Wide Web (W3). In addition,
the possibility of coloring the patterns has been introduced along with
other tools to facilitate the creation of two-dimensional crystalline
structures.
