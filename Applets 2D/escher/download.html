    <p>
      The instructions below describe how to go about downloading
      Escher Web Sketch, and an appropriate Java Run-time Environment
      that you will need to run it.  Until operating systems become
      more java capable out of the box, this isn't as easy of a
      process as it should be...
    <h2>The Java Run-time Environment</h2>
    <p>
      You will need a copy of either the java run-time environment or
      a java developer's kit.  Instructions for downloading and
      installing these two products can be found on www.javasoft.com's 
      web pages:
    <ul>
      <li> <a
      href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html">The
      Java Run-time Environment</a> (Windows95/NT, and Solaris).  <li>
      <a
      href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.0.2/installation.html">The
      Java Developer's Kit</a> (Windows95/NT, MacOS, and Solaris).
      <li> For use on other architectures you will have to find one of
      the two above packages ported to whatever type of computer you
      are using.
    </ul>
    <h2>Downloading Escher Web Sketch</h2>
    <p>
      Download Escher Web Sketch here in one of the following
      compressed formats:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="escher.zip">escher.zip</a>
      <li><a href="escher.tar.gz">escher.tar.gz</a>
      <li>(sadly, I can't provide a stuffit archive)
    </ul>
    <h2>Running Escher Web Sketch</h2>
    <p>
      (You'll need to unpack one of the above two archives first).
    <ul>
      <li>Unix: Run "<b>jre escher</b>" or "<b>java escher</b>"
      <li>Win95/WinNT: Run the "<b>escher.bat</b>" script.  (You may have to modify
	the script if you didn't pick a default installation path for
	the Java Run-time Environment).
      <li>MacOS: Drag the escher.class file onto the <i>java</i>
	application included with the java developers kit.  (A better
	MacOS solution is forthcoming)
    </ul>
